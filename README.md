## Welcome to Rongrong's Webpage Pages


This is Rongrong, I’m a student at the University of Florida and will be graduating in May 2018.
I was employed by Amazon.com as a SDE intern for 2017 fall. My responsibility was to develop a full-stack project for the consumer payments team. I also worked for several health institutes for developing iOS apps. My interests lay in developing full-stack web app and mobile apps. 
On the day to day life, I utilize my communication skills, express my own ideas and commit wholly to the final decision. In addition, I always clear out ambiguities with others and work independently to get the work well done. Also, I’m active to seek ways to do better and think long term on any project that is assigned to me. Lastly, I am quick to jump in and pick up new technologies as well.
